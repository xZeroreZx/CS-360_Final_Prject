# CS-360_Final_Prject
This is a repository of the Whoa Weight application created for SNHU CS-360 Final Project

With the Whoa Weight application the user was intended to be able to createe a profile, complete with credentials (username and password).
A database was intended to store the credentials. An activity was then supposed to be called in order to verify the users identity.
Upon entering the application, the user was intended to be able to add their goal weight that they intended on achieving. Through another storage databse,
a user would have been able to input their daily weight, which would be set in the databse with a date that they entered it. 
Upon entering a new weight, the application would have returned an output table that gve the user a view of their inputs, and a calculation to how far they had to go to achieve their goal.
The user would have the capability to locate a previously entered weight and edit it, or remove it. 

When the user was close to reaching their goal, the application was intended to respond through SMS messaging that they were getting cvloer to their goal.

Permissions were either granted or denied, and the application would have functioned even through denial.

The design should have been self explaitory and easy to navigate for the user. 

I attempted to impliment a flow between the first screen and the one that the user would see next. While coding, I started with the login screen, where a current user can log in or register. 
I focused on the registration portion first, and assigned the database to handle table creations. From there, an activity would be called to locate a user, when they had registered, and were trying to sign in. The next portion was to create a way for the user to add their weights, and goals. 
Setting a goal was the first direction that I had taken to achieve this. Setting the goal, and returning an ouput to a table for easily understanding what it was that the user wanted to achieve. 

The volume of googling solutions to the bugs that I ran into, were so massive that I eventually forgot where I was in the app development. 
I woulded through the night, initially, for 36 hours, and another 15 hours the following day just to get the application to function as intended. In the end, I changed one thing and found that I broke my application somehow. Exhausted and frustrated, I realized that I was out of time with this assignent. 

I was impressed with myself in only one aspect of this design and development, and that was being able to understadn and create a database that can be accessed. On my first attempt I was able to create tables, labeled exactly as I wanted them to be. Accessing them returned actual results, and it was something I really enjoyed showing others.
